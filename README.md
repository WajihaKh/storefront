In Phase 1, we have set up the basic structure of the e-commerce application with category-based product filtering. The application uses Redux for state management, ensuring a scalable and maintainable codebase. The UML diagram provides a visual representation of the component structure and their interactions, aiding in understanding the flow of data and user interactions.
